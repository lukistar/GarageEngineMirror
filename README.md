GarageEngineMirror
==================

https://github.com/vova616/GarageEngine without sound (mirrors cannot reflect sound :))

Couldn't resolve some hidden dependencies (error: AL/al.h: No such file or directory, error: AL/alc.h: No such file or directory, or something like that...)
... So just removed them :)

This should work on Windows 7 without any problems.(if you have followed the instructions on https://github.com/vova616/GarageEngine)

Download and Install:
go get github.com/lukistar/GarageEngineMirror
